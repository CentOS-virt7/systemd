Subject: [PATCH] load-fragment: use UNESCAPE_RELAX flag to parse exec
 directives

The cunescape() helper function used to handle unknown escaping sequences
gracefully by copying them over verbatim.

Commit 527b7a42 ("util: rework cunescape(), improve error handling") added
a flag to make that behavior optional, and changed to default to error out
with -EINVAL otherwise.

However, config_parse_exec(), which is used to parse the
Exec{Start,Stop}{Post,Pre,} directives of unit files, was not changed along
with that commit, which means that directives with improperly escaped
command line strings are no longer parsed.

Relevant bugreports include:

  https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=90794
  https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=787256

Fix this by passing UNESCAPE_RELAX to config_parse_exec() in order to
restore the original behavior.

(cherry picked from commit 22874a348fb1540c1a2b7907748fc57c9756a7ed)
