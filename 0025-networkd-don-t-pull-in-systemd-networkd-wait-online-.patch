Subject: [PATCH] networkd: don't pull in systemd-networkd-wait-online service
 from systemd-networkd when enabling

networkd-wait-online should never exist in the default transaction,
unless explicitly enable or pulled in via things like NFS. However, just
enabling networkd shouldn't enable networkd-wait-online, since it's
common to use the former without the latter.

(cherry picked from commit 324d7a53b9c53b33520b97f2562219ac4143f581)
